PROV Bench is a collection of PROV datasets and accompanying queries. These benchmarks can be used to develop and compare different techniques for provenance application. The list of benchmarks appears in the following areas:

* [provbench user](https://github.com/provbench?tab=repositories), the initial collection, "by value" in git repositories.
* [provbenchers organization](https://github.com/provbenchers), the extended collection of "by value" git repositories (with better grouhp permissions management).
* [datahub.io group](http://datahub.io/organization/provbench), a curated "by reference" collection of pointers to other external benchmarks.
* [datahub.io tag](http://datahub.io/dataset?tags=provbench), a free-form cllection of "by reference" benchmarks that anyone can add to.

This "meta" repository is used to manage the organization, see the [wiki](https://github.com/provbench/meta/wiki) and [issues tracker](https://github.com/provbench/meta/issues).
